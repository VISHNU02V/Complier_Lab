LIST OF EXPERIMENTS
-------------------
1. Design and implement a lexical analyzer using C language to recognize all valid tokens in the input program. The lexical analyzer should ignore redundant spaces, tabs and newlines. It should    
   also ignore comments.
2. Design and implement a recursive descent parser for a given grammar.
3. Construct a Shift Reduce Parser for a given language.
4. Implement Intermediate code generation for simple expressions.
5. Write a program to convert NFA to DFA.
6. Write a lex program to display the number of lines, words and characters in an input text.
7. Write a lex program to find out total number of vowels and consonants from the given input sting.
8. Implement a Lexical Analyzer for a given program using Lex Tool.
9. Write a program to perform constant propagation .
10. Write a program to find First and Follow of any given grammar.
11. Implement the back end of the compiler which takes the three address code and produces the 8086 assembly language instructions that can be assembled and run using an 8086 assembler. The target 
    assembly instructions can be simple move, add, sub, jump etc.
12. Generate a YACC specification to recognize a valid arithmetic expression that uses operators +, â€“ , *,/ and parenthesis .
13. Implementation of Calculator using LEX and YACC.
